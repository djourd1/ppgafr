## Meeting Links

The meeting will be organized on-line and we will use Zoom. 

*We will ask you to connect to the links that we will provide you 15 minutes ahead of the meeting time so that we can solve the usual connection issues.*

As the quality of the connexion might be an issue for some of the participants, they may consider having several participants for one connexion. We will send you the details for a proper connexion to the meeting at least one day in advance.


### Zoom


### Klaxoon
For the afternoon sessions, we will also use a whiteboard application (Klaxoon). Klaxoon does not require any prior installation, and you will use it in your browser. For both platforms we will send you a link before the session start.

## Language
The language used during the meeting and for presentations will be English. 

## Recording
If all participants agree, the discussions will be recorded and later made available to all participants.
