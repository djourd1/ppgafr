## Meeting Links

The meeting will be organized on-line and we will use Zoom. 

*We will ask you to connect to the links that we will provide you 15 minutes ahead of the meeting time so that we can solve the usual connection issues.*


### Zoom

We assume that everyone is familiar with Zoom. We will send you the necessary links.


### Klaxoon
For the afternoon sessions, in addition to the Zoom session, we will also use a whiteboard application (Klaxoon). Klaxoon does not require any prior installation, and you will use it in your browser. 

To join us on `Klaxoon`, follow these instructions:

1 Open your browser and open the [Klaxoon website](https://klaxoon.com)

2 On the left of the screen, you will see an invitation to enter a code:
