## Bio

I am sociologist at Cirad, and a research fellow at the University E.Mondlane, Faculty of letters and social sciences,  Maputo Mozambique. 

My research focuses on health risks related to animals in LMICs:  foot-and-mouth disease, antimicrobialresistance (AMR), zooonis (avian flu, Ebola, arenavirus...), in a One Health perspective. 

I am currently working in Mozambique, on the organisation of the vet drug market chain and the implementation of the national action plan on antimicrobiol resistance. 



## Expertise

+ Value chain analysis (farming systems, market chains, and food systems): social organisations, collective action, inclusiveness and governance

+ Impact analysis of animal health standards and sanitary crisis on small-scale farmers and traders

+ Risk governance analysis (food related risks, zoonosis, emerging infectious diseases): public perception and management of risks (consumers, livestock keepers, traders…), vulnerability and resilience, communication and trust.
