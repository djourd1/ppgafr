## Short bio
I am a Cirad researcher, based in Mozambique since January 2015, after 9 years based in Harare, Zimbabwe. I am currently coordinating since 2015 the regional Research Platform « Production and Conservation in Partnership » (www.rp-pcp.org). My field of research is the ecology of infectious disease transmission at wildlife/livestock interface through behavioural and community ecology approaches. I also coordinate since 2018 projects related to sustainability sciences in relation to the coexistence between People and Nature in Transfrontier Conservation Areas (KAZA and GL TFCA).

## Areas of Expertise

+ Disease ecology 
+ Sustainability sciences

## Current activities related to public policies and governance in Africa

EU funded ProSuLi project that explores how biodiversity conservation and the betterment of local livelihoods in TFCAs can both be promoted. The project has a strong emphasis on local community governance: for local livelihoods, and within the management of TFCAs.
