## Short bio

Cori Wielenga is acting director of the Centre for Mediation in Africa and a senior lecturer in the Department of Political Sciences, University of Pretoria. Her research interest is in the intersection of formal and informal governance systems on the African continent, and on non-traditional actors in periods of transition. 

To this end, she has undertaken research on the gacaca courts in Rwanda, traditional courts in Namibia, the role of women in ‘justice on the ground’ in southern Africa, and most recently, together with the Universities of Ghana and Makerere, women’s political representation in the institution of traditional leadership in a comparative study of Ghana, Liberia, South Africa and Botswana.

In this area of research, her assumption is that the institution of traditional leadership is here to stay, and her interest is in deepening our understanding of how the institution of traditional leadership functions. Understanding it better has the potential to allow for more effective conflict resolution interventions and governance systems. 

She is also leading a project, together with the ILO, on the role of business in South Africa’s transition to democracy, which includes a reflection on the role of business in our current Covid-19 crises.
