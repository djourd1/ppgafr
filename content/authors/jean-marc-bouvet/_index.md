I hold a master in forestry science and a master in plant genetics as well as a PhD in management of genetic resources and quantitative genetic. I also hold an accreditation to supervise research. (French post-doctoral degree allowing its holder to supervise PhD students)

Since joining CIRAD in 1985, I have been involved in research, training, project setting up and coordination, as well as in expertise in domains related to forest genetic resources, agroforestry and biodiversity conservation. I served as team leader and research unit director. I was positioned abroad from 1986 to 2001 in Madagascar and in the Republic of the Congo, in French Guyana, then positioned in France. During the period 2001-2015, I was able to interact with many partners in Africa, South America, South East Asia and in the Pacific.

During my career, the coordination of multidisciplinary projects and his expertise activity have allowed me to have a broad vision of development issues through agronomic, environmental, technological, economic and social sciences. 

I have also participated in the supervision of twenty doctoral students and thirty master's students.

I have been positioned at CIRAD in Madagascar since 2016, where I served as coordinator of the Platform in partnership for research and training: « Forests and biodiversity in Madagascar».
