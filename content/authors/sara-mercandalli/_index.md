## Short bio

Sara Mercandalli currently works at the Département Scientifique Environnements et Sociétés (ES), Cirad as a member of ART-Dev Lab. 

She holds a PhD in economics from the University Paris XI and does research in Institutional Economics, Development Economics and Quantitative Social Research. Initially her research focused on the role of labor migration in restructuring rural households’ livelihoods, looking in particular at the migration development nexus and policy implication in the context of sub-Saharan demo-economic transition. In the last years, she has expanded her research angle towards the interconnections between rural migration, employment and regional development.
