Senior Crop Scientist at CIRAD, Montpellier, France, Tanguy Lafarge is the Cirad Delegate for the 21 platforms for research and training in partnership since 2019. 

These platforms have been established by Cirad and its partners in many regions (1 in Maghreb, 7 in Western and Central Africa, 5 in Southern Africa and Indian Ocean, 4 in South-East Asia, and 4 in Latin America and the Caribbean region). His main mission is to facilitate and empower the whole network of platforms, notably coordinating interactions between platforms of the same theme but from different regions, encouraging the development of degree training like master degree courses, amplifying collaborations with the civil society including the private sector and farmer's organizations, and increasing the international exposure. 

After graduating from the University of Paris XI (1998), Tanguy Lafarge has worked as a researcher for APSRU, Queensland, Australia, and as an assistant professor in Plant Physiology for the University of Montpellier. Hired by CIRAD in 2002, he moved to IRRI, Philippines, for 8 years as an international recruited staff. After having served IRRI as Deputy Director of the Crop and Environmental Sciences Division for 2 years, Tanguy decided to come back to CIRAD, Montpellier in 2010, where he was appointed as leader of the PAM team (Phenotypic Plasticity and Adaptation of monocots).

Tanguy Lafarge has more than 25 years of experience in cereal adaptation to climate change and in increase in rice yield potential. His research deals with the analyses of Genotype x Environment x Management interactions and the design of ideotypes improving resources use efficiency in relation to carbon assimilation and partitioning and phenotypic plasticity, namely addressing the superiority of hybrid rice over inbred lines. He integrates diversity data from metabolite and tissue (gas exchange, sugar dynamics, and organ vigor) to crop level with help of simulation studies and phenotyping protocols. In linking phenotype to genotype diversity, he works closely with molecular breeders and contributes to gene discovery.
