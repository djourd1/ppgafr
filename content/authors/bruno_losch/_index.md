## Short bio
Dr. Bruno Losch is currently based at the University of Western Cape, South Africa, and lead political economist at Cirad (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement – France – ArtDev research unit).

Over the last three years, he has been working with NEPAD (Rural Futures Program), OECD, UNDP, and AfDB (Africa Economic Outlook 2015), ILO (employment in Africa), and he was involved in research activities related to the UN International Year of Family Farming (IYFF 2014).

He joined the World Bank between 2005-2011 where he led the RuralStruc Program on structural transformation and rural change—a joint initiative of the World Bank, IFAD, and the French government. Previously, he was a visiting scholar at the Institute of International Studies (University of California–Berkeley), and in charge of Cirad’s Family Agriculture Program (1998-2002).

He holds a Master’s in political science and in geography and a PhD in economics. He has published extensively in the field of rural studies, family agriculture, public policies, and the political economy of development. Before resettling in South Africa, he was a member of the scientific and technical committee of the French Global Environment Facility (FFEM).
