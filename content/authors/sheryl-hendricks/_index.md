## Short bio
Professor and Head of Department for Agricultural economics, Extension and Rural Development.
 
My research focusses on food security policy analysis and programme intervention design. Much of my work has largely focussed on African food security policy. Through this research, I have had the privilege of supporting country food security and nutrition policy and programme design in support of the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP).  I have been involved in the development of evaluation systems for national agriculture, food security and nutrition plans for the African Union and large international development agencies. I teach food security policy analysis and monitoring and evaluation at the graduate level. I enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams and have participated in numerous international consensus papers on a range of topics related to food security including nutrition, food systems, food policy change, nutrition policy and land-use change.  I am actively engaged in high-level global food security policy think tanks and panels, including the Montpellier Malabo Panel and the Science Group of the 2021 World Food Systems Summit.
