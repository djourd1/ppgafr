Jean-François Le Coq is an agro-economist at the Centre for Cooperation in Agronomic Research for Development (CIRAD), and a researcher at the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). A specialist in institutional and policy analysis related to agricultural development and environmental issues, his research focuses on understanding policy processes (design, implementation and impact) related to sustainable development in the context of climate change, with an emphasis on coordination and governance issues.

With over 10 years of experience in research projects in Latin America, he currently coordinates the inter-institutional research network on "public policies and rural development in Latin America" (PP-AL) and the Latin American policy research component of the CGIAR programme "Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security" (CCAFS).
