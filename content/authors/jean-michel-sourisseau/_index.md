## Short bio
Jean-Michel Sourisseau is economist and lead researcher at Cirad (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement - France), and is deputy director of the joint research unit "Actors, Resources and Territories for Development" (ART-Dev). After a PHD on household strategies in the large irrigated systems in Senegal Delta and « Office du Niger » in Mali, he worked on pluriactivity of rural families and on its implication on grassroots development policies. 

From 2005, he currently worked in New Caledonia, where he initiated a large survey on kanak tribes’ economy, with a specific focus on non-monetary exchanges. Multifunctionality of agriculture and diversity of family farming around the world are recurring themes he undertakes, implementing finalized research. 

He is CIRAD's focal point on Family Farming. He participates actively to the UN decade of Family Farming, launched in Rome in April 2019. Recently, his researches focus on agriculture intensification pathways in the face of Sub-Saharan Africa demographic challenges, articulating household approaches and territorial perspective in Mali, Madagascar, Togo and Burkina Faso.
