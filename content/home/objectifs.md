The purpose of this online meeting is to brainstorm with already research institutions in Africa about the construction of a partnership platform that would focus on how governance and policy innovation processes can foster the inclusiveness and sustainability of the following inter-related systems in Africa: (a) rural and territorial systems, (b) agricultural and food systems, (c) managed and natural ecosystems; and (d) how to manage sanitary and systemic risks affecting them

Collaborative activities of the partnership could include:
+	analysing and anticipating changes among these different systems and their effects at different scales and on the different sectors/actors;
+	studying and supporting the appropriate processes for the design of new governance modes and public policies to adapt to uncertainty and anticipated changes;
+	developing more direct links between research, policy debates and policy making at different scales;
+	contributing to training and education in line with the related new challenges faced by African countries.

What do we want to be achieved by the end of the meeting? 

We target at least these three objectives:

+	Know better the potential members of the network and their current research areas and methodologies. This should help everyone identifying the partners with whom they could team-up with in future collaborative projects/activities. 
+	Identify issues and methodologies that are cutting across the systems each partners are focusing on, or by contrast methodologies that have been used for one system/in one context that could be tested on another system/in another context. This should help the network to come-up with/develop new research ideas. As such, we intend to discuss the possible joint activities and research projects.
+	Initiate discussions about the way to organize the partnership?
