The African continent is undergoing a rapid transformation, as global forces (such as globalization, technological advances, climate change, global economic or health crises) and local forces (such as demographics, diet changes, political transitions, and social aspirations) interact in complex ways, at and between the different scales of territorial development. This generates a myriad of complex, wicked, interconnected problems (natural resources depletion, conflicts, migrations, food and nutrition insecurity, global health issues, etc.) with contrasted social, economic and environmental consequences.

A better understanding of the processes at work is required to explore:

+	How governance and public policies address the new challenges African countries are facing;
+	How to contribute to the design and implementation of appropriate new forms of governance and public policies;

Multidisciplinary research communities will be needed to effectively document and understand how governance and public policies can help solving these new challenges.
